        <p>
        To the technical bitcoin community,
        </p>
        <p>
        We believe that the activation of <span class="code">OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY</span> (CTV) (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki">BIP-119</a>) and <span class="code">OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK</span> (CSFS) (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0348.md">BIP-348</a>) is the appropriate next step for bitcoin. These opcodes enable crucial functionality for a broad set of uses that will allow bitcoin to preserve and expand its role as a scarce, censorship-resistant store of value.
        </p>

        <p>
        While there are a few promising proposals to improve bitcoin at the consensus layer which may someday be deployed, we believe that CTV and CSFS are uniquely well reviewed, simple, and have been proven to be both safe and widely demanded.
        </p>

        <p>
        CTV was first formalized in BIP-119 over 5 years ago. Despite many attempts at refinement or replacement, it has remained the most widely preferred method for enforcing pregenerated transaction sequences using consensus. It unlocks valuable functionality for scaling solutions, vaults, congestion control, non-custodial mining, discrete log contracts, and <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/op_checktemplateverify/#optech-newsletter-and-website-mentions">more</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        CSFS is a primitive opcode that has been deployed to Blockstream’s Elements for at least 8 years. It represents no significant computational burden over bitcoin’s most often used opcode, <span class="code">OP_CHECKSIG</span>. It can be combined with CTV to implement <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eltoo/">ln-symmetry</a>, a longstanding improvement to Lightning. It also unlocks a variety of <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/op_checksigfromstack/">other use cases</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        We respectfully call on the Bitcoin Core project to prioritize the review and integration of CTV (PR <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31989">#31989</a>) and CSFS (PR <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32247">#32247</a>) into Bitcoin Core within the next six months. We believe this timeline allows for thorough final review and activation planning.
        </p>

        <p>
        As application and protocol developers, we are convinced of the significant benefits that these changes would bring to end users of bitcoin &ndash; even if only considering their use for layer 1 security and layer 2 scaling solutions like Ark and LN. We are optimistic that given the limited size and scope of these changes in both concept and implementation, they represent a realistic next step in the continuing and important work of preserving bitcoin's unique promise.
