        <title>CTV + CSFS</title>
    </head>

        <p>
        We believe that the activation of <span class="code">OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY</span> (CTV) (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki">BIP-119</a>) and <span class="code">OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK</span> (CSFS) (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0348.md">BIP-348</a>) is the appropriate next step for bitcoin. These opcodes enable crucial functionality for a broad set of uses that will allow bitcoin to preserve and expand its role as a scarce, censorship-resistant store of value.
        </p>

        <p>
        While there are a few promising proposals to improve bitcoin at the consensus layer which may someday be deployed, we believe that CTV and CSFS are uniquely well reviewed, simple, and have been proven to be both safe and widely demanded.
        </p>

        <p>
            CTV was first formalized in BIP-119 over 5 years ago, and despite many attempts at refinement and reinvention, its implementation has been materially unchanged since then. It unlocks valuable functionality for scaling solutions, vaults, congestion control, mining improvements, discrete log contracts, and <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/op_checktemplateverify/#optech-newsletter-and-website-mentions">more</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            CSFS is a primitive opcode that has been deployed to Blockstream’s Elements for at least 8 years. It represents no significant computational burden over bitcoin’s most often used opcode, <span class="code">OP_CHECKSIG</span>. It can be combined with CTV to implement <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/eltoo/">ln-symmetry</a>, a longstanding improvement to Lightning. It also unlocks a variety of <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/op_checksigfromstack/">other use cases</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        We respectfully call on the Bitcoin Core project to prioritize the review and integration of CTV (PR <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31989">#31989</a>) and CSFS (PR <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32247">#32247</a>) into Bitcoin Core within the next six months. This timeline allows for thorough evaluation and activation planning while meeting the community’s persistent demand for these enhancements. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Should this deadline pass without meaningful progress, we are prepared to fork Bitcoin Core and apply a minimal patch to implement the activation logic for these opcodes. Such a step would be taken with the utmost respect for bitcoin’s consensus process and a commitment to its long-term success.
        </p>

        <p>
We do not embark on this lightly. As application and protocol developers, we are aware of the significant benefits that these changes would bring to end users of bitcoin &ndash; even just considering their uses for layer 2 scaling solutions. The apparent disconnection of the Bitcoin Core project from these developments has confused us, and we can't help but conclude it indicates a growing risk to bitcoin. We would prefer to continue as a unified project, but the long-term resilience of bitcoin itself against impedance by a single institution is a higher goal.
