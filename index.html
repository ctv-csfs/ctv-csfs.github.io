        <p>
        We the signatories believe that the activations of <span class="code">OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY</span> (CTV) (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0119.mediawiki">BIP-119</a>) and <span class="code">OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK</span> (CSFS) (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0348.md">BIP-348</a>) are the appropriate next steps for bitcoin. These opcodes enable crucial functionality for a broad set of uses that will allow bitcoin to preserve and expand its role as a scarce, censorship-resistant store of value.
        </p>

        <p>
        While there are a few promising proposals to improve bitcoin at the consensus layer (which may someday be deployed), we believe that CTV and CSFS are uniquely well reviewed, simple, and have been proven to be both safe and widely demanded.
        </p>

        <p>
            CTV was first formalized in BIP-119 over 5 years ago, and despite many attempts at refinement and reinvention, its implementation has been largely unchanged since then. It unlocks valuable functionality for scaling solutions, vaults, congestion control, mining improvements, discrete log contracts, and <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/op_checktemplateverify/#optech-newsletter-and-website-mentions">more</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            CSFS is a primitive opcode that has been deployed to Blockstream’s Elements for at least 8 years. It represents no significant computational changes over what bitcoin’s most often used opcode, CHECKSIG, already does. It can be combined with CTV to implement ln-symmetry, a longstanding improvement to Lightning. It also unlocks a variety of <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/op_checksigfromstack/">other use cases</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        We respectfully call on the Bitcoin Core project to prioritize the review and integration of CTV (PR <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31989">#31989</a>) and CSFS (PR <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32247">#32247</a>) into Bitcoin Core within the next six months. This timeline allows for thorough evaluation while meeting the community’s persistent demand for these enhancements. Should this deadline pass without meaningful progress, we are prepared to fork Bitcoin Core and apply a minimal patch to implement the activation logic for these opcodes. Such a step would be taken with the utmost respect for bitcoin’s consensus process and a commitment to its long-term success.
        </p>

        <p>
We do not embark on this lightly - however, the lack of engagement on the part of the Bitcoin Core project to undertake the important work of furthering bitcoin's scripting capabilities has surprised us, and we conclude it indicates a growing risk to bitcoin. We would prefer to continue as a unified project, but the long-term resilience of bitcoin itself against capture by a single institution is more important than social cohesion.
